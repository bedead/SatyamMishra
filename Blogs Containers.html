            <h2>Basics of Conitioning and Learning</h2>
            <h5>Conitioning and Learning is a topic related to Pscyology<br>Date : 2021 Nov 29</h5>
            <img src="blogs/psycology-image.jpg" alt="Brain icon" style="max-width: 500px;max-height: 500px;min-width:80px;min-height:80px;">
            <p>Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was a Russian scientist who investigated the digestive system of dogs by presenting them with meat powder and measuring the amount of saliva they produced.</p>
	    <p>Pavlov found that the dogs began to salivate even before the meat powder was presented as they associated the feeder with the meat powder.This led Pavlov to conclude that the dogs were conditioned to respond
		to the feeder through the process of classical conditioning.</p>
	    <p>Researchers Watson and Raynor wanted to test the idea that fear could be acquired through classical conditioning.</p>
	    <p>Their subject was Little Albert, an Eleven-month-old son of a female employee at the clinic. The child's mother knew nothing about the experiment.</p>
	    <p>Watson and Raynor presented Albert with a white laboratory rat while aounding a loud noise. Little Albert soon rat and was conditioned to fear the rat. 
		This fear was then generalised to other fluffy white objects such a Santa's beard and a sealskin coat.</p>
	    <p>It is not know whether this intense fear was reversed. There were many ethical issues in this experiment that were overlooked.
		Ethical guidlines for psychological research have certainly improved and are much different today.</p>

            <h2>Best Intel and Ryzen processors</h2>
            <h5>Best Gaming processors<br>Date : 2021 Nov 29</h5>
            <img src="blogs/processor-image.jpg" alt="Processor image" style="max-width: 500px;max-height: 500px;min-width:80px;min-height:80px;">
            <p>Gifting yourself with the most powerful CPU on the market isn’t alone going to help you. It is effective only if you are going to pair it with the right rig. Especially for the gaming freaks out there, bringing in a beasty gaming CPU doesn’t alone create an impact if it isn’t accompanied by a powerful GPU, decent RAM, and storage with faster access speeds. Remember, power is a cumulative factor.

		    Most people find themselves in the gluepots to decide whether AMD or the Intel that is actually the best. Trust me, this debate has the potential to start another World war. There is active research going on in Area 51 to decide a clear winner. Wink Jokes apart! AMD with its recent lineup has pushed itself in the race giving tough competition to Intel processors. However, most-expensive mainstream
		    Intel processors do slightly better in terms of gaming. When it comes to tasks like content creation and video editing, the AMD processors have an upper hand, 
		    thanks to the extra threads and cores.</p>
	    <br>
            <p>The Intel Core i5 10600K isn’t the fastest out there but trust me, it does better than some priced in-house alternatives, and most AMD processors in the race. While the Core i9 10900K from Intel is the most expensive and powerful dude out there at the time of writing this article,
		    the Intel Core i5-10600K does arguably better in certain aspects especially considering the price for which it is being offered.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>AMD mastered the art of building processors to handle multi-threaded workloads. The Ryzen 5 3600X is one such masterpiece that changed the way people looked at AMD. It comes with six-cores and 12 threads like any other Ryzen 3000 series chip.
		    This nifty piece of hardware comes with a 3.8GHz base and a 4.4GHz boost clock and has a TDP of 95-watt.</p>
